Hi, I'm Shangzhi Xu, undergraduate student from BUPT. My research instreasts are **Software Engineering and Security**. To be specific, Program Analysis and System Security. I have some experience related to static analysis and fuzzing.

I completed my undergraduate internship at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) where I was supervised by Prof. Weiping Wen on use IFDS algorithm to analyze Java programs and detect XSS, SQL, deserialization vulnerabilities .

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://stonebuddha.github.io/files/cv_wang.pdf)

## **PROJECTS**

### Fuzz Test on WPS                 

Teleworking, August. 2022 – Present

Research Intern, supervised by Prof. Chao Zhang from THU 

**Description**: Conduct fuzzing test on chinese popular software WPS from kingsoft company 

**Responsibilities**: 

·    Compete the fuzz test and conduct investigation and survey about WPS

·    Base on ZAFL to carry out the fuzz test  

### Java Program’s Vulnerability Mining and Intrusion Detection (JVD)   

Beijing, Feb. 2021 - Jul. 2022 

Researcher, supervised by Prof. Weiping Wen from Peking University

**Description**: The project aimed at developing a set of vulnerability scanner for Huawei, to detect vulnerabilities like Deserialization, XSS, SQL Injection, and Null Pointer Call in the system. We also adopted RASP to block malicious inputs.

**Responsibilities**: 

·    Converted Java code to jimple code based on Soot, found the vulnerabilities according to IFDS algorithm and improved scanner performance via Def-use graph 

·    Realized the detection and interception of hostile attacking stream based on the established vulnerability database and Baidu open software OpenRasp

**Achievements**: Improved the vulnerability detection rate to >90%

 Detecting vulnerability type correctly rate >85% 

 Locating vulnerability position correctly rate >85%

 

### **Python NLP Project: Chat_bot** **and Search Engine**               

Beijing, Sep. 2021 - Jun. 2022

Researcher, supervised by Prof. Yulong Wang & Prof. Xiuquan Qiao from BUPT

**Description**: Realized NLP with python, designed a Chat_bot program and a Search Engine program with improved properties that could be better used in reality. 

**Responsibilities**: 

·    Based on NLTK and Parse, designed the Chat_bot script, realizing functions like automatic testing, key words stemming, sentence analysis, spelling correction, synonym matching etc.

·    Based on NLTK, used Django and realized a demo of search engine, used Selenium to crawl news, tf-idf algorithm to extract key words, NLTK to extract input info on the user’s end, and cosine similarity to determine final matching

**Achievements**: Chat_bot program scoring 96/100 (ranking Top 5/170+)

​     *Github:* [*https://github.com/ShangzhiXu/Programming-practice-chat_bot*](https://github.com/ShangzhiXu/Programming-practice-chat_bot)

​    Search Engine program scoring 94/100

## **INTERNSHIP**

**Hillstone Corporation**                       Beijing, Jul. 2021 - Sep. 2021

Security R&D Intern

·    Conducted analysis work on Binary virus’ behavior and wrote reports

·    Applied tools like IDA, x32dbg, ollydbg to achieve virus’ decrustation and analysis

·    Used C++ to develop a program of finding blank space in PE file’s, adopted windows API to fill the blank space with random bytes and generated new virus, thus remedied the defect of new virus’ detouring of searching engines

·    Compiled the work with an article published on the *Network Security Technology & Application Journal*. Issue 2, 2022
